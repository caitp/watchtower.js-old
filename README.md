#Watchtower.js [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/caitp/watchtower.js.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/caitp/watchtower.js)

Super-fast change detection for AngularJS 2.0, based on Mi≈°ko Hevery's
[draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10W46qDNO8Dl0Uye3QX0oUDPYAwaPl0qNy73TVLjd1WI/edit?usp=sharing),
and the implementation in [Angular.dart](https://github.com/angular/angular.dart/blob/master/lib/change_detection/).

The goal is to offer change detection which is extremely performant, supports watching the result of method
invokation and getter/setter functions, and puts 0 pressure on the GC. Algorithms should be written in a
fashion which makes VM optimization possible.

Testing should cover both behaviour as well as performance, as it is extremely important that applications
can handle thousands of watched expressions, with minimal memory and performance cost.
